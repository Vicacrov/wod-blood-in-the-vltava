> A popular blood peddler in Prague, Josef has his fingers deep in the human trafficking business, his empire spread wide over one of Europe's porn capitals. It is said the poor, lost souls wandering the city, eventually wind up dead or sold to one of his Kindred clients. Once a respected figure among the Ventrue, having been the most reliable, and elegant source of blood the city could hope for amongst its more sleazy blood lords, he eventually lost much of the positive status after he emerged in his true identity; a Lasombra, wolf in sheep's clothes, as if rising from the dead skin of a Blue Blood in his full, shadowed glory.

> During his time masquerading as a Ventrue, Josef has sired two childer who now operate as the face of his business; Silvestr, and Václav, both bearing his last name as a signature of legacy.
> 
> As of recent times, Josef has gone rather quiet, with the disappearance of Václav. It would seem it's time to rake in a few of his many boons...
