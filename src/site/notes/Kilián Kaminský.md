![kilian.png](/img/user/kilian.png)
## Notes

- Childe of [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza Králová]]
- Indebted to [[Josef Kolar\|Josef Kolar]]
- Is tasked with finding [[Václav Kolar\|Václav Kolar]]
- Coteriemate of [[Alistair Rathburn\|Alistair Rathburn]] and [[Potkan\|Potkan]]
## Disciplines

> [!NOTE]- Dominate
> ### Cloud Memory
> By uttering the phrase “Forget!” the user can make the Dominated victim forget the current moment as well as the last few minutes, enough to mask a superficial feeding or a chance meeting. No new memories are formed and if pressed the victim realizes they have a few minutes missing.
> ■ Cost: Free
> ■ Dice Pools: Charisma + Dominate vs Wits + Resolve
> ■ System: No roll is required against an unprepared mortal victim. Clouding the memory of a resisting victim or another vampire requires a Charisma + Dominate vs Wits + Resolve roll.
> ■ Duration: Indefinitely
>### Dementation
> ■ Amalgam: Obfuscate 2
> This subtle power requires nothing more than casual conversation, as the vampire’s insidious influence hides between the lines and inflections employed. The victim finds themselves increasingly agitated as their inner demons bubble to the surface, eventually drowning out all rhyme and reason.
> ■ Cost: One Rouse Check per scene
> ■ Dice Pools: Manipulation + Dominate vs Composure + Intelligence
> ■ System: After engaging in conversation with a victim, the user can activate this power. For the duration of the scene, the user may attack a single individual each turn in a Manipulation + Dominate vs Composure + Intelligence conflict, causing Superficial damage to Willpower. A mortal who becomes Impaired by this power experiences a nervous breakdown or psychotic break, the shape and nature of which depends on their personality (and perhaps their blood Resonance). A vampire that becomes Impaired by this power must immediately succumb to a Compulsion, as chosen by the power’s user. If the user wants to affect multiple victims, they need to make a separate Rouse Check for each one.
> ■ Duration: One Scene
>### Mesmerize
> The vampire can issue complex commands to a victim, as long as they have the subject’s gaze and relative quiet in which to issue instructions. The instructions must be carried out immediately to the victim’s best ability, and must not contain any conditional actions (“...if you see Henry, give him the document”), as this would require the victim to exercise cognition.
> ■ Cost: One Rouse Check
> ■ Dice Pools: Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve
> ■ System: No roll is required against an unprepared mortal victim. Commanding a resisting victim or another vampire requires a contest of Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve. Commands that go against the victim’s nature also require such a contest.
> ■ Duration: Until the command is carried out or the scene ends, whichever comes first.

> [!NOTE]- Obfuscate
>### Ensconce
> The vampire is able to supernaturally conceal small objects in their hands or on their person. The power doesn’t make visible objects invisible. Rather, it makes a searcher ignore them when they’d otherwise notice.
> ■ Cost: None
> ■ System: The Kindred can hide a number of small, hand-held objects in their hands or on their person equal to their Obfuscate rating. Mortals ignore dangerous or out-of-place objects that the user is enshrouding or miss them in a search. Kindred with Sense the Unseen or others with supernatural senses can attempt to notice them as usual. Objects in plain view cannot be hidden by this power, nor can animate creatures.
> ■ Duration: One scene
>### Unseen Passage
> With this power, the vampire can now move around while staying hidden. The user is functionally invisible, per the usual Obfuscate limitations.
> ■ Cost: One Rouse Check
> ■ System: As long as the user emits no overpowering odours and no sound louder than a whisper, this power automatically works. Only if the observer has their attention drawn to the user can they make a detection roll. Sense the Unseen (Auspex 1) can also detect the hidden vampire, as per the general Obfuscate rules. Note that the user cannot use this power to disappear while being actively observed; it automatically fails in such a case.
> Sense the Unseen rule: Against an entity actively trying to stay hidden, the Storyteller can call for a blind roll (“Lisa, roll seven dice for me”) as a contest against the target’s relevant pool. (For example, detecting a vampire using Obfuscate would be a roll of Wits + Auspex vs Wits + Obfuscate) If the vampire actively searches for a hidden supernatural entity, they roll Resolve + Auspex similarly.
> ■ Duration: One scene or until detection

## Merits and Flaws

> [!NOTE]- Merits
> ### City Secrets •
> You have somehow acquired a damning secret about the city’s Kindred power structure, perhaps specifically about someone in it. Decide the exact nature of the information with the Storyteller.
> A few power players in the city know you have this information, or strongly suspect it. Hopefully, you’ve made arrangements for the secret to get out upon your mysterious disappearance. You could sell this information for a high price, but its truest value is protection: those who want it to stay secret have some interest in keeping you happy. Of course, if you push your luck, they may decide keeping you quiet forever takes higher priority.
> This Background resembles Influence more than Status in some circumstances; the Storyteller should determine when or if it adds to a Social pool, or possibly a Research or Insight test.> 
> ### Haven •
> Small haven, but more secure and private than the default. Examples: basement apartment, crypt, locked storeroom in a warehouse.>
> ### Ingénue •
> You look completely innocent and blameless, making others believe in your good intentions much easier. Add two dice to any rolls related to avoiding suspicion or deflect blame, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
> ### Resources ••••
> Rich: Great condo or nice house, luxury items, highend equipment for several people
> ### Side Hustler ••
> Folks on the fringes constantly have to grind to keep the little that they have. Juggling a million tasks, favors, and debts has become second nature to them.
> Once per session you can get your hands on an item, a piece of information, or access to an event as if you had two dots in the appropriate Resources, Contacts or Influence Background. (Items obtained with Resources likely have to be returned intact.) Often this requires you to spend part of the night calling in markers and pressing your informal network.
> ### Status •
> Known: A properly introduced, welcomed neonate, seen as an up-and-comer

> [!NOTE]- Flaws
> TBA

## Backstory

Kilián Kaminský was never a clever man, but he was a _clever_ man.

His childhood and teenage years zoomed past without any major trauma or big incidents. He grew up in a nuclear family, just climbing up to the lower middle-class. However, having always something on the table, yet not being able to afford all the fancy gadgets - the first mobile phones, portable audio players, or even just nice clothes - has always left Kilián dissatisfied. Every now and then, his parents did gift him something above their payroll, but that just deepened their son's hunger for *more*.

Kilián never had any dream careers or hobbies that he stuck with, but by high school, he had one aspiration: to get rich, no matter the method. For a few years, he got caught up with the wrong crowd and did small-time break-ins for the local gangs, enthralled by the aspect of scoring big and quick. The thrill was new and intoxicating, but by his senior year, he realised that this will never get him to the top, to where money really was.

Well-paying jobs that required further education such as medicine or law, were out of question: he knew his limitations, but he also knew his strengths. He was exceptional in handling people and during his criminal years, he had first-hand seen how little people cared for the security of their belongings... Yet how much pain it caused them to lose any of them. Thus, he made a simple, but an oh so profitable conclusion: people were terrified of losing everything they had, but they just did not know how scared they were. All he had to do was to make them *realise* it. 

After high school, he bounced between a few jobs in the security sector to see their internal workings: then, at the age of 23, in 2007 with the help of a hefty loan, he started his own company called the "K Company". It is a widely accepted theory that he named it after himself; however, the truth is that he named it after the protagonist of Franz Kafka's last, unfinished novel, _The Castle's_ K. He never shared this fact with anyone, but he secretly felt very proud of it.

The K Company or K-Comp for those pesky millennials who suddenly started to abbreviate everything started out slow with an average quality of services. What made it immensely successful was the marketing: Kilián used the power of fear and urgency in their campaigns, while employing cheap labour in the form of grad students specialising in human studies - or, what he called, the "future unemployed" - to collect and research statistics about criminal rates and the financial damages one can suffer. These statistics were, of course, skewed to fit his narrative: something that anyone could have looked into to see how false it was, but nobody really cared. And by the time K-Comp was known and used Prague-wide, whether its existence was based on the truth or a lie, it was just accepted as a _necessity_.

By the age of 30, Kilián was rich. He did not enjoy monopoly over his business' sector, but he focused on dealing with big companies country-wide - they had the most to lose, after all, and as such, they spared no expenses to protect their assets. In the late 2010s, cybersecurity became an increasingly big problem, something that the K-Comp was not well-versed in. Kilián started looking into the matter, trying to learn just its basics to know what to look for and how to expand his company with it, but something inconvenienced him on the way.

He died.

He has met his future Sire, [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza Králová]] a few times before, but he never *noticed* her. After all, she never sit with him at the big tables: she always stood by the side in the meeting rooms, serving drinks or she was seated completely elsewhere in the fancy restaurants he met his clients at. Kilián was also a man who never cared about romance or even close friendships: all his social relationships were purely transactional. But [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza]] saw him. She saw him crystal clear.

Kilián was Embraced for one reason only. It was not to take his assets, his money, or his position: it was only to humble him. His Sire grabbed the man winning capitalism, yanked him off from the top of his castle down into the dirt everyone else he preyed on was, then took him by the shoulders and told him: it was time to pray the price.

Malkav's vitae in his veins kept his consciousness lucid during his full death and just like every other progeny of his, it fractured his sanity into countless pieces. [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza]]'s blood reanimated him, but he never truly felt returning to Earth. In his perception, this was no longer the world he once lived in: this was his own, personal purgatory, designed to look what his life once was, but never again could be. He never believed in God and this moment did not make him seek His forgiveness either - it was too late, anyhow -, but he instinctively _knew_ what his situation was. A series of trials that would determine his fate.

[[Tereza Králová\|Tereza]] saw a soul to be saved in him: Kilián saw a game that was rigged against him that he could never win. The first year with his Sire was spent in learning to hunt, mostly as a Siren, but these nights, he cannot remember much of it: he had mental breakdowns every fortnight and he was terrified out of his mind by his mentor whenever he was in her vicinity. When his delusions came to the forefront, she was no mere Kindred older than him: she was an angel, a demon, and karma itself sent to punish him. [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza]] never hurt him, she has barely if ever raised her voice with him. But it did not matter - she could not reach the heart of a man's who never let a single person close to him. He feared and revered her, and he did not know how to react to praise and kindness.

Therefore, her Sire changed tactics. No longer shielding her progeny from the world of Kindred, she decided to see the world from his perspective and guide him as such. She told him that he is going to enter the society of similar of him: a society that will swallow him whole and destroy his soul without regret if he showed weakness. How he would appear strong, that would be left up to him, but he had to survive until he redeemed himself. The next night, [[Tereza Králová\|Tereza]] left the city.

Kilián only knew one method to control people: fear. After his introduction, he attended a few Elysia and observed it quietly. He soon learnt that this society was built upon paranoia and appearances, two areas he excelled in as a mortal - he also learnt that manipulating the mind is not so difficult, after all, even if sometimes he did not know what kind of emotions he was stirring up in his conversational partners. And so, he donned his suit, his most charming smile, and the most unnerving half-truths: and he became one of Prague's socialites who always appeared prim and proper, who always exchanged pleasantries, but someone who was _just_ a bit too unnerving to talk to for more than a few minutes.

Nobody loved him, but he was not unwelcome at any social gathering. Nobody considered him a big threat to get rid of him, but everyone knew he had something on the Prince that made them think twice to carelessly use him as a pawn. He was someone everyone wanted to keep close for entertainment and sometimes information, but given his clan, only at arm's length.

The perfect way of surviving until his judgement comes. Alone.
## Derangement

Kilián believes that his Kindred state is what many calls it: damnation, but not Hell just yet. He believes his life is over and mindlessly chasing money and joy is no longer priority, that finding happiness is no longer an option. Instead, he has to find redemption, but he has no idea what led him here in the first place - and as such, he does not know what he was supposed to be doing.

Whenever his derangement comes to the front, and often during his compulsions or even his clear moments, he perceives the world around him as something that is trying to guide him or straight up punishing him, but in a language he does not understand. The people around him are angry at him not because he cracked a disgusting joke, but something he cannot read from the situation. The door in front of him shuts close, but only for him; even if his peers tell him the room is wide open, he believes only _they_ can enter it because they possess something he does not. Genuine caring from someone is a cruel joke from those responsible for his fate, showing him what he could have once had, but never sought out in life because he was _faulty_.

Sometimes, Malkav's insanity results in clarity: sometimes it is a vampire's madness that shows him the way to humanity, that a hallucination steers him towards the right thing to do. He only has to understand it.
