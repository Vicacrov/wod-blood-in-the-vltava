# Disciplines
## Dominate
### Cloud Memory
By uttering the phrase “Forget!” the user can make the Dominated victim forget the current moment as well as the last few minutes, enough to mask a superficial feeding or a chance meeting. No new memories are formed and if pressed the victim realizes they have a few minutes missing.
■ Cost: Free
■ Dice Pools: Charisma + Dominate vs Wits + Resolve
■ System: No roll is required against an unprepared mortal victim. Clouding the memory of a resisting victim or another vampire requires a Charisma + Dominate vs Wits + Resolve roll.
■ Duration: Indefinitely
### Dementation
■ Amalgam: Obfuscate 2
This subtle power requires nothing more than casual conversation, as the vampire’s insidious influence hides between the lines and inflections employed. The victim finds themselves increasingly agitated as their inner demons bubble to the surface, eventually drowning out all rhyme and reason.
■ Cost: One Rouse Check per scene
■ Dice Pools: Manipulation + Dominate vs Composure + Intelligence
■ System: After engaging in conversation with a victim, the user can activate this power. For the duration of the scene, the user may attack a single individual each turn in a Manipulation + Dominate vs Composure + Intelligence conflict, causing Superficial damage to Willpower. A mortal who becomes Impaired by this power experiences a nervous breakdown or psychotic break, the shape and nature of which depends on their personality (and perhaps their blood Resonance). A vampire that becomes Impaired by this power must immediately succumb to a Compulsion, as chosen by the power’s user. If the user wants to affect multiple victims, they need to make a separate Rouse Check for each one.
■ Duration: One Scene
### Mesmerize
The vampire can issue complex commands to a victim, as long as they have the subject’s gaze and relative quiet in which to issue instructions. The instructions must be carried out immediately to the victim’s best ability, and must not contain any conditional actions (“...if you see Henry, give him the document”), as this would require the victim to exercise cognition.
■ Cost: One Rouse Check
■ Dice Pools: Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve
■ System: No roll is required against an unprepared mortal victim. Commanding a resisting victim or another vampire requires a contest of Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve. Commands that go against the victim’s nature also require such a contest.
■ Duration: Until the command is carried out or the scene ends, whichever comes first.
## Obfuscate
### Ensconce
The vampire is able to supernaturally conceal small objects in their hands or on their person. The power doesn’t make visible objects invisible. Rather, it makes a searcher ignore them when they’d otherwise notice.
■ Cost: None
■ System: The Kindred can hide a number of small, hand-held objects in their hands or on their person equal to their Obfuscate rating. Mortals ignore dangerous or out-of-place objects that the user is enshrouding or miss them in a search. Kindred with Sense the Unseen or others with supernatural senses can attempt to notice them as usual. Objects in plain view cannot be hidden by this power, nor can animate creatures.
■ Duration: One scene
### Unseen Passage
With this power, the vampire can now move around while staying hidden. The user is functionally invisible, per the usual Obfuscate limitations.
■ Cost: One Rouse Check
■ System: As long as the user emits no overpowering odours and no sound louder than a whisper, this power automatically works. Only if the observer has their attention drawn to the user can they make a detection roll. Sense the Unseen (Auspex 1) can also detect the hidden vampire, as per the general Obfuscate rules. Note that the user cannot use this power to disappear while being actively observed; it automatically fails in such a case. (Sense the Unseen rule: Against an entity actively trying to stay hidden, the Storyteller can call for a blind roll (“Lisa, roll seven dice for me”) as a contest against the target’s relevant pool. (For example, detecting a vampire using Obfuscate would be a roll of Wits + Auspex vs Wits + Obfuscate) If the vampire actively searches for a hidden supernatural entity, they roll Resolve + Auspex similarly.)
■ Duration: One scene or until detection
