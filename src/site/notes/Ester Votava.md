Ester Votava is a Ventrue Primogen, and the Keeper of Elysium. Her primary occupation is with organizing Elysia in Prague, often held within different venues in the city, but on occasion, within Prague Castle, which most Kindred know she greatly favors.

She is also known to organize the private meetings of Clan Ventrue, presumably in locations out of other Kindred's knowledge, and her goals lie within restoring Kindred influence over mortal places, her principles strongly centered around territory and domain.
