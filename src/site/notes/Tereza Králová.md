- [[Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián Kaminský]]'s Sire.
- Her derangement is saviour complex, she has an obsession with saving people. Sometimes this saving is helping them out with monetary means, sometimes it is kidnapping them and giving them a scare, then releasing them once again to make them see what is truly important in their lives. Sometimes it is mercy-killing them; whatever the method is, it is often out of touch with reality. Embracing or ghouling is something she has never considered or done before, [[Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] is the first and only exemption of this rule.
- She is currently out of Prague, but she has already sent a message to the Prince that she intends to return in the following weeks to check on her Childe - and on her favourite Prince, to see if she needed _any help_.
