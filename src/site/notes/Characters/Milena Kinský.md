Lady Milena Kinský, a Ventrue of Antonius' lineage and a member of the noble Kinský family, took over the position of Prince when the former Prince ==Markus== died during the Second Conclave of Prague in 2021. Following his and his Seneschal's destruction, the then Herald took arms, and led the retaliation effort against the Anarchs in the city. Milena has seen every last one of them wiped, converted to Camarilla rule, or ousted from the city, and has officially declared the Movement an enemy in Prague.

If her Anarch policy did not repel the younger of Prague's Kindred, her ban on technology certainly did; with few exceptions, following the Second Inquisition crackdown and cases of vampire haven raids as a result of the increased conflict in the city, she has banned most uses of technology.

True and fervent Camarilla loyalists respect her as a fierce leader, but most others mistrust her - not to mention those who have been forced into the Sect absolutely despise her. The Ventrue of the city see her as a modern knight and strategist, true to her lineage, if a harsh extremist at that. 

As a result of this reputation, though she is present at every ball and Elysium, rarely do Kindred outside of the Primogen council initiate interactions with the Prince, even those of her very own Clan - most simply don't want to get on her bad side so they'd rather avoid her. Still, she somehow seems to track most Kindred and their actions extremely well, leaving the residents of Prague that would otherwise enjoy a city rife with blood to be rather paranoid.

She is typically found in the New Town Hall in New Town, but sometimes deviates to concealed offices within the Prague Castle.
