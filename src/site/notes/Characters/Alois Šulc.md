> *Alois is the head of a Herald coterie in the city, called the Daywalkers, and one of four Thinbloods permitted in the city.*
> 
> *The Daywalkers are a group of three Thinblooded Kindred capable of venturing into daylight. They are all branded by the Chantry, and bound to a Tremere Apprentice named ==Ilona==. Though she is Alois' regnant, he is still the face of the faction.*
> 
> *The Daywalkers offer an excellent and discreet service, but they are treated with a grain of mistrust thanks to their binding, which many suspect is a means for the Chantry to view their private business.*
