### _"Stay curious, indifference is the death of the soul."_

- [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián Kaminský]]'s touchstone. A serious, but life-loving woman, she works at the city's police force, the only female detective in her division. She is immensely dedicated to her work and has a wide variety of hobbies that often help her solve her cases.
- He met [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] after his death in the "Riegrovy sady" park, where she often goes to do some kind of creative hobby (drawing, knitting, or similar), before or after work, to wind down. She knows [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] as Kazimir and has no clue he is the CEO of a security company she often has troubles with in her line of work; she knows Kazimir as a stock trader. Despite his "boring" job, the man charmed him enough that whenever they meet, they have a chat and a laugh before one of them makes a work-related excuse and leaves. It became a recurring gag for her to try to teach him whatever she was doing at the moment: be it dog walking or creating a cute amigurumi on the spot.
- [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] is fascinated by her because despite her cruel job - she often handles the worst crimes, including murder and kidnapping - she remains open and curious about the world, and even though she often sees humanity at its worst, she always remains kind with those around her.
