> *The younger of the Kolar brood, Václav, is his sire's right hand. He has always stood out, with an easy going attitude, looks that are easy on the eyes, and an awfully warm aura in contrast to what one may expect of his Clan, most who rely on [[Characters/Josef Kolar\|Josef's]] services pray the knock that eventually comes on their door will see it open to the younger Kolar's face, rather than his brother's.* 
> 
> *Despite this, and despite his many superficial connections and popularity in Elysia, few seem to know much about him. He has a girlfriend, an indie-fluencer by the name of ==Naděžda Paček==; he works for his Sire; he is never a bother to be around.*
> 
> *Perhaps such lack of sharing and true allies, is what would eventually lead to him going missing in September of 2024.*
