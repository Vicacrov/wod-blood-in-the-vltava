> *The Nosferatu Clemens is the strangest figure in Prague's Primogen Council, as more than being an advisor to the Prince, he is her direct opposer. In fact, Clemens seems to attend the Council meetings simply to reap the rewards of his position and collect his cheque, rather than give anything to the city in return.*
> 
> *This brings many to wonder why the Prince has not executed him for openly opposing her, and as a direct result, most speculate he either simply outranks her due to being one of the last Elders in the city while the Prince is merely an Ancilla, or that he has some dirt on [[Characters/Milena KinskÃ½\|Milena]] that no other Kindred does.* 
> 
> *Either way, so long as you are not the Prince, Clemens is an elegant and approachable man who knows the city best from everyone else - if one does not mind his boggled eyes or the faint scent of raw meat that one can pick up off him past the layers of expensive cologne. His Clan is certainly not picky, simply content with the position of privilege they have in Prague instead.*
