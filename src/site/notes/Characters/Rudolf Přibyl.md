### _"Turnabout is fair play."_

- [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián Kaminský]]'s Touchstone, he works at the Prague Zoo as a veterinarian, often on night shift.
- He met [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] after his death. [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] targeted his wife during one of his hunts - catching her infidelity through his company -, but during one of their meetings, she showed up with her husband. Initially, [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] dominated him without a second thought, to make him leave them alone for the duration of the feeding; but once he was full and he could put the dull wife to the side, he had a chat with Rudolf and became interested in him.
- [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] started to seek him out because of his enthusiasm about animals - something the Malkavian has never experienced or understood. For him, animals were little creatures that never liked him in life and they were afraid of him in death: still, he has been curious ever since why so many "regular people" were obsessed with them.
- Rudolf eventually found out about his wife's affairs and divorced her. Despite his kind and warm disposition, [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] learnt that the man was super thorough with the legal process: he made sure his wife lost everything in court and more, destroying the woman he was completely enamoured with a few months prior.
- A few times Rudolf walked [[Characters/Kilián Kaminský\|Kilián]] around the night-time zoo, showing him some nocturnal animals, but they made no progress in making him understand why they were so "wonderful". Eventually, Rudolf introduced his dog, Polka to the Kindred, resulting in the most hilarious sight: two creatures being more afraid of each other than the other.
