> *Bláto is yet another Herald in the city. He operates a heraldry service called the Noční Express, with a business partner going by ==Řezník== and an occasional third employee called ==Kvitkovsky==. Their business revolves around delivering letters and other courier items within the hour inside the city.*
> 
> *The Noční Express is relatively popular, thanks to its fullblooded and unbound owners, who most Kindred believe have no business or time to mess with their deliveries.*
