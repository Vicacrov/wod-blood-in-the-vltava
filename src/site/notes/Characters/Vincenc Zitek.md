The Seneschal of Prince [[Characters/Milena Kinský\|Kinský]].

His origins are much shrouded in rumor and mystery, since he was a lesser known socialite before the conflict that followed the Second Convention; most presume he comes from a wealthy background which had allowed him and the Prince to cross paths before her rise to rule, and that the two have formed a trusting relationship around that time - which most Kindred follow with much less polite choices of words to describe the Prince and her Seneschal's relationship.

What is known, though, is that he is a Toreador with an exceptional eye for detail, which most speculate is thanks to his use of Auspex. In fact, his very presence is what most chalk the feeling of paranoia reigning the city up to, often feeling watched when Vincenc is around.

He is typically found inseparably from [[Characters/Milena Kinský\|Milena]], as her closest advisor and as some speculate, a sort of bodyguard.
