Stela Červený leads the Prague Chantry.

Three decades ago and much before the fall of Vienna, when she'd still served as a Magister in the local Chantry, predicted a vulnerability in keeping the Tremere fortress within the secret chambers of Czechia's National Library. The increased frequency of mortal visitors to the city and its tourism worried her, and thus she came up with and pitched the idea of breaking the previously large group into smaller Chantries throughout the city.

After the fall of Vienna in 2008, where the local Chantry's leader had perished during a planned visit, she was promoted to the role instead as the next fitting candidate in line.

The High Regent is known to be rather open minded and nurturing of her students, a sentiment dismissed by most of the Clan outside the city. Ominously enough, though, Prague does not seem to ever house any Tremere who are unfit within its Chantry, and no one quite keeps track of who exactly studies within it.

She is harder to reach than most outside of Elysia, but is known to sometimes meet non-Tremere Kindred in The Globe Bookstore.
