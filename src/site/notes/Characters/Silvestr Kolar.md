> *The elder of [[Characters/Josef Kolar\|Josef's]] two childer, Silvestr is his sire's left hand. He grasps, beckons, and sometimes, makes a fist.* 
> 
> *Though he was Embraced specifically to fulfill the role of speaking to people on his Sire's behalf so he does not have to, few desire the quiet and apathetic Silvestr as a conversation partner. Instead, he tends to bring about an uneasy air of unpleasantness around him, for Kindred knowing just how painful it is to be touched by a shadow for extortion - or perhaps just if they might say the wrong thing.*

- Broodmate of [[Characters/Václav Kolar\|Václav Kolar]]
