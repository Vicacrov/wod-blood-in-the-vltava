Zámecký is an interesting figure.

Known for collecting the most aesthetically pleasing and romantic of trinkets, such as beautifully bound first editions of romance books, meticulously made pieces of art with striking landscapes and smooth techniques, and marble statues polished to perfection, she seemingly adores every perfect silhouette and every well-crafted storybook ending. 

Perhaps her appreciation for the finished product is often what makes her own cold disposition appear so uncanny. Polite, and well-presented, but as if she simply were not there.

Regardless of her dichotomous nature, Regina is the proud owner of the National Museum and is often found there.
