The Gangrel Sheriff is an absolute exception to his Clan, being one of the most larger-than-life people one can come across in the city. He is a large man in both width and height, with an enthusiastic and very casual attitude.

However, despite the Bear's lovable personality, he is also incredibly enthusiastic for ripping out the spines of Blood Hunted Kindred, which understandably leaves his peers wary and careful about falling for vibes alone.

He happily follows the orders of the Prince, and though he may have absolutely been more liked were he not in the position of Sheriff, he seems to have shed those social barriers as well in order to make unlife for himself a lot less consequential and reach some kind of undead happiness, absolutely vessled through a love for alcohol-laced blood.

Serebryakov is supposedly posted in a secluded courtyard in Vy≈°ehrad, but most spot him in bars all over the city boisterously engaging with visiting tourists.
