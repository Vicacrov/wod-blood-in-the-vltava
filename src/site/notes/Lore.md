## Blood in the Vltava - Introduction

Our story is set in current day Prague, where three young Neonates are brought together by [[Characters/Josef Kolar\|Josef Kolar]] - a popular blood peddler with a controversial reputation - to repay him the boons they each owe him. The task he gives this rag tag bunch of strangers? Retrieve his Childe, [[Characters/Václav Kolar\|Václav Kolar]], within two weeks' time - or suffer the consequences of leaving him to his fate.
## ## A Brief on Prague's History

The original founding of Prague as a Kindred territory is somewhat lost to history, but the medieval legend still lives on; of how the Brujah Prometheans thwarted the Tzimisce Premysls here once upon a time, followed by a rather obscure and long rule of Nosferatu Prince ==Josef Zvi==, for approximately 700 years before his destruction in 1938.

Prague would see more chaos after the Sabbat had reared its head with interest to reclaim the Prague Castle for its Tzimisce constructors, during the reign of the Toreador ==Vasily== who'd taken over after ==Josef Zvi's== demise. Despite a then allied Voivode's best efforts, a Sabbat pack would go on to awaken torpid and dangerous Kindred within an archeological site outside the city, an event that kicked off mistrust between the local Camarilla and any non-Sect allies they'd had. 

This mistrust culminated in 1998 when a retired Brujah Justicar by the name of ==Carlak== was berated by ==Vasily==, and in the aftermath put him into torpor and after being accepted by the local Primogen, kept his former imprisoned and went on to try and gain influence in both mortal circles across Europe and the favor of his Kindred peers.

Rising tensions between the various factions of the both the city and vampiric sects worldwide, threatened by the whispers of a Second Inquisition, came to their peak during the disastrous outcome of the First Conclave of Prague in 2012, when the Brujah ==Theo Bell== had kicked off a Third Anarch Revolt.

The many casualties and resulting downfalls of the Camarilla across Europe saw ==Carlak== forced to step down, succeeded by the Ventrue ==Markus==. The peace in Prague was never reclaimed onwards, a cold war worldwide continued to rage between the Camarilla and the Anarch Movement. Another attempt to quell the conflict was made by Prince ==Markus== in 2021, who'd invited Kindred from all over the world to his Domain for closure within the same grounds the differences first made the two Sects hostile with one another, but the meeting was abruptly cut short when a Second Inquisition squad attacked the event, and solidified the mistrust for good.

Then Court Herald [[Characters/Milena Kinský\|Milena Kinský]] took control of the city when its uppermost governing body perished under the attack, calling a Blood Hunt on any and all Anarchs in the city. She instilled a technology ban within the city to turn the SI agents in the city blind as possible, and led a war effort to wipe the Movement from Prague for the foreseeable future, which she'd ruled as an achievement by 2022.

In the following aftermath with the war ending, Prince Kinský has focused her strategy around laying low, creating inconspicuous influences, and mapping out the city for re-emergence of Kindred control. By 2024, this control has been regained and the SI has cast its eyes elsewhere in the world, allowing the Camarilla to recover its glories.
## Sect Policy in Prague

Prague is currently under sovereign Camarilla rule. The Traditions and a Technology Ban are enforced by the Prince, her chosen staff and Enforcers.

The Movement and the Sabbat are forbidden from setting up base in Prague.
Kindred are disallowed from engaging in or promoting in these Sect's ideas. 
Other, minor Sects are unwelcome in Prague.

🔴  Officially, all other Sects are regarded as Enemies of the Camarilla. 

Kindred identifying themselves as Anarchs, Sabbat or any other Sect found in Prague, are classed as if under a Blood Hunt. 
The discovery of Anarch alignment is grounds for hostility. No means are prohibited in eliminating them. Camarilla members are permitted to call upon Enforcers to get rid of Enemies, or do it themselves. Diablerie of Enemies is still subject to judgement and trial by the Prince.

Kindred of enemy sects do have the option to surrender themselves and take an oath to swear fealty to the Camarilla.
Converts are kept under a tight Blood Bond for a year following their defecting to their Camarilla, as probationary Sect members.

🟠  The exceptional Sect to this rule are the Hecata, who had sided with the Camarilla during its war on the Movement.

The sect is kept at an arm's length under a Cautious status, with a very small base of operations with few permanent residents, and a strictly monitored stream of guest stays.

__

It is important to note, that though identifying in any way other than Camarilla in the city is grounds for hostility, the city is not entirely without other factions and loyalties.

The punishment for aligning with ideas outside the Traditions may be harsh, but the Camarilla is not entirely able to eradicate freedom of thought. 

## Technology Ban

Kindred in Prague are prohibited from using technological means to communicate or conduct themselves any other way. This is due to previous hunting of Kindred in the city by the Second Inquisition following the Second Convention of Prague.

The preferred method of remote communication is an offline service provided by various Heraldry factions in the city, verified by the Prince. 

Kindred found using or smuggling technology into sensitive areas such as Elysia or private, vampire-only meetings with one another, may be subject to harsh trial by the Prince.

__

Though the ban is enforced, Kindred in Prague - especially on the younger side - typically circumvent the ban by keeping a "mortal" side of themselves alive through social media and modern devices, whilst all their business with other vampires is usually held offline, or kept to very minimal and coded traceable communication methods, such as phones.

Some exceptions to the rule exist as well, as Kindred seeking to provide or use services that do take advantage of technology may appeal to the Prince for permissions, while providing sufficient evidence of the taken security and encryption measures. 
## Primogen Council

The Primogen council of Prague consists of four Kindred; the Tremere High Regent [[Characters/Stela Červený\|Stela Červený]], the Ventrue [[Characters/Ester Votava\|Ester Votava]], the Toreador [[Characters/Regina Zámecký\|Regina Zámecký]], and the Nosferatu [[Characters/Clemens\|Clemens]]. Though Prague's Primogen council simply consists of influential figures in the city that are well familiar with it, rather than Clan representatives, it is the open secret that their Clans are often the most privileged.

On occasion, the Primogen invites guest Advisors who are typically the leader figures in the less powerful clans of the city, though their word gets much less definitive attention than that of the Primogen.
